Written the early 2015.

The ouput file contains the printed output of the application, it contains the calculated matrix, the tasks chosen and their sum.

The goal is to choose the tasks that produce the highest fees within a set number of days.

A few notes:

-   I have decided to keep the amount of variables and method calls to a minimum for performance reasons. Generally I always prefer to "comment" my code with intuitive method names and variables.

-   I decided not to split the code into multiple files since I feel that the program is so small that it would just make it more difficult to navigate in that way.
